The car whisked him away, disappearing as it turned the corner.

I suppose if this was back when people still travelled by foot, they could have carried on further together: as far as the city gates, as far as her legs could carry her, or far enough to be back in time for one's responsibilities.

They could have carried on in silence, or they could have carried on reminiscing, with tears or with laughter. 

That final moment could have gone on longer, but progress cut it short.
