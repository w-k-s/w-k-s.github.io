I learnt to code from YouTube, switched careers by getting a Masters Degree in Software Engineering and then started working as an Android Developer. So I didn't know all too well what ERPs and CRMs are. I mean I kinda had an idea, but couldn't figure out where one ended and the other began. The fuzzy boundary confused me.

With time, I think I've got a better idea so this article is meant to explain it in a way that's clear to me (i.e. I'm the dummy, not you (unless you are me)).

## ERPs 

The core functionality of an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) Software is that it manages business financials. This is done through a General Ledger that keeps track of money coming in and money going out. 

But financials here also includes assets like machinery and inventory, and tracking payments to and from vendors and customers.

Typically, an ERP solution offers modules that increases the scope of what it manages. For example, a logistics module would allow it to keep track of Supply chain and feed that data directly into the accounting.

## CRMs

A CRM (Customer Relationship Management) Software centralises customer data and provides a holistic and historical view of the customers relationship with the company.

What this means depends on the context because CRMs, like ERPs, can be specialised for a particular industry. 

So a CRM for hospitals keeps track of the medical history, prescriptions, encounters. 
A CRM for an e-commerce website keeps track of past orders, money spent, loyalty e.t.c.

CRMs are very useful to discover customer demographics and market segments. These can be used by the marketing team to better target customers with ads and promotions.

**Note**: Some ERPs incorporate CRMs.

## Conclusion

The way I summarise this in my head is that I consider ERPs as the back-end of the business (as it's mostly concerned with business operations) while CRMS are the front-end (they're mostly concerned with providing customers a better experience).
