## About

This is a blog about my journey from breaking into the world of Software Development (despite my degree in Chemical Engineering) and going from Mobile Development, to Backend and then to Architecture and Engineering Management.

I don't want this to be a purely technical blog nor do I want this to be a very personal one (*shudders at the very thought*). I'd like to go somewhere in the middle: Something that's relatable but educational.
